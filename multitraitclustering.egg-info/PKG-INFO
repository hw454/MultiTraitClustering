Applies clustering methods to GWAS data to identify separate pathway groups.
The clustering methods handle association data across many phenotype traits.
The output will also return the pathway enrichment for the clusters.

Input type: `filename.csv` should contain the association scores between SNPs
and phenotypes. Each row corresponds to a SNP and each column corresponds to
a trait. The first column is the SNP rsid labels. The first row is the trait
labels.
